## Development Philosophy

Following the "teach, don't just code" principle:
1. **Docstrings explain the "why"** - Not just what parameters mean, but why functions exist
2. **Comments explain complex logic** - Non-obvious algorithms have step-by-step explanations
3. **Error messages are actionable** - Tell users what went wrong AND what to do
4. **Safety is prioritized** - Destructive operations require explicit confirmation
5. **Examples are provided** - Key functions show usage examples in docstrings

The codebase is now maintainable by someone who didn't write it, teachable to someone learning Python, and safe to operate in production.

---

## Session 2 - February 5, 2026
**Focus**: Railway deployment and scaling preparation

### Summary

---

## Next Session - Immediate Tasks

### Priority 1: Cleanup & Security
1. **Remove temporary upload endpoint** from web_app/app.py
   - Delete `/admin/upload-db` route (security risk if left in production)
   - Remove temp files: temp_upload.py, upload_db.sh, upload_endpoint.py
   - Commit cleanup changes

### Priority 2: Background Worker Setup
2. **Add second Railway service for scraping**
   - Configure scraper service in Railway dashboard
   - Share database volume between services
   - Test manual scraping trigger

### Priority 3: Scale to 1000+ Speakers
3. **Run 4 scraping sessions** (200 events each)
   - Session 1: Scrape 200 events → extract speakers
   - Session 2: Scrape 200 events → extract speakers
   - Session 3: Scrape 200 events → extract speakers
   - Session 4: Scrape 200 events → extract speakers
   - Target: 1,000-1,200+ unique speakers

## Notes for Next Session

### What's Working
- ✅ Web interface live and password-protected
- ✅ Search functionality works with 443 speakers
- ✅ Database persists on Railway
- ✅ Auto-deployment on git push
- ✅ SSL/HTTPS included
- ✅ Zero server management needed

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Temporary upload endpoint still in code (security risk - remove ASAP)
- ⚠️ Only one service running (need background worker for scaling)
- ⚠️ Database small (443 speakers vs 1000+ target)

### Decision Made
- **Hosting platform**: Railway (chosen over Hetzner/Vercel)
  - Reason: Zero sysadmin, same code works as-is, good for long-running tasks
  - Cost: $10-15/month during scaling, $5-8/month maintenance
  - Trade-off: Slightly more expensive than Hetzner but much easier

### Strategy Adjustments
- **Original plan**: Scale locally then deploy
- **Adjusted plan**: Deploy first, scale on server (user's laptop not always on)
- **Temporary two-service architecture**: Heavy scraping via background worker
- **Final architecture**: Single service with cron after scaling complete

### Railway Lessons Learned
1. Nixpacks auto-detection works but requires Procfile for non-standard app structure
2. Flask must be in requirements.txt even if working locally
3. PORT environment variable required for Railway (dynamic assignment)
4. File upload via HTTP more reliable than Railway CLI for large files
5. Auto-deployment on git push is very convenient

---

## Development Philosophy (Continued)

**Session 2 additions:**
- **Deploy early, iterate often** - Got live version working first, will scale later
- **Simple solutions first** - HTTP upload endpoint simpler than fighting with CLI
- **Security by default** - Added password protection before sharing
- **Document as you go** - Created deployment guides during implementation
- **Clean up after yourself** - Note to remove temporary code in next session

---

## Session 3 - February 5, 2026
**Focus**: Background worker setup and Railway infrastructure debugging

### Summary
Attempted to configure second Railway service for background scraping. Encountered multiple Railway-specific infrastructure issues (Dockerfile compatibility, environment variables, volume sharing). Successfully resolved web service issues and implemented persistent storage with Railway volumes. Scraper service configured but volume sharing remains challenging.

### Achievements

#### Background Worker Infrastructure (Partial ✅)
- ✅ **Created railway_scraper.sh** - Script for running scraping sessions
  - Configurable event count (default: 200)
  - Headless Chrome mode
  - Statistics display after completion
- ✅ **Created RAILWAY_BACKGROUND_WORKER.md** - Complete setup guide
  - Step-by-step service configuration
  - Environment variable setup
  - Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ **Added second Railway service** (`scraper`)
  - Configured with `sleep infinity` start command
  - Environment variables configured via reference to `web` service
  - Built successfully with Dockerfile

#### Railway Infrastructure Fixes (Completed ✅)
- ✅ **Fixed VOLUME keyword error**
  - Removed `VOLUME /data` from Dockerfile (Railway doesn't allow)
  - Railway manages volumes separately via dashboard
- ✅ **Fixed Dockerfile CMD conflict**
  - Changed default command from `main_selenium.py` to `web_app/app.py`
  - Web service uses default CMD (Flask)
  - Scraper service overrides with `sleep infinity`
- ✅ **Fixed environment variable whitespace bug**
  - Trailing spaces in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` caused "Illegal header value" error
  - Deleted and re-added variables without whitespace
  - Search functionality restored
- ✅ **Implemented Railway volume persistence**
  - Created volume mounted at `/data`
  - Updated code to use `/data/speakers.db` on Railway, `./speakers.db` locally
  - Database survives redeploys
  - Tested persistence with forced redeploy - confirmed working

#### Environment Variable Configuration
- ✅ **Switched to shared variable references**
  - Web service maintains primary API keys
  - Scraper service references web's variables via `${{web.VARIABLE}}`
  - Single source of truth (user's preference for maintainability)

### Challenges Encountered

#### Railway-Specific Limitations
1. **Volume sharing not straightforward**
   - Railway doesn't support Docker Compose-style shared volumes
   - Each service creates its own volume
   - No built-in way to mount same volume to multiple services
   - Attempted but couldn't find option to connect scraper to existing web volume

2. **Ephemeral filesystem**
   - Every redeploy wipes non-volume files
   - Database lost multiple times during debugging
   - Required re-upload after each fix

3. **Dockerfile compatibility issues**
   - VOLUME keyword banned (Railway manages volumes separately)
   - Default CMD affects all services using same Dockerfile
   - ChromeDriver version mismatches

4. **Environment variable propagation**
   - Variables with trailing whitespace caused HTTP header errors
   - Required explicit redeploys to pick up variable changes
   - Shared variables feature unclear/not working as expected

### Files Modified/Created
```
Modified:
- Dockerfile (removed VOLUME, changed CMD to Flask app)
- web_app/app.py (added get_db_path() for Railway volume support)

Created:
- railway_scraper.sh (scraping script for background worker)
- RAILWAY_BACKGROUND_WORKER.md (setup guide)

Deleted:
- railway.json (caused "Dockerfile does not exist" error)

Commits: 407b3cf, e0ee210, 6c2fde0, 4433f63, 1b47cde, 02e77ce
```

### Current Status

#### What's Working ✅
- Web service live at Railway URL with password protection
- Search functionality working with 443 speakers
- Database persistence via Railway volume at `/data/speakers.db`
- Verified persistence across redeploys
- Scraper service built and running (sleep infinity)
- Both services have environment variables configured

#### What's Not Working ⚠️
- **Volume sharing between services** - Railway limitation
- Scraper can't write to same database as web service
- Need alternative approach for scaling (manual sync or PostgreSQL)

#### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Temporary upload endpoint still in code (security risk - remove after scaling)
- ⚠️ Scraper service can't access web's database volume
- ⚠️ Stats endpoint returns 0 counts (bug #6 in backlog)

### Railway Infrastructure Learnings

**Key Discoveries:**
1. **Railway volumes are service-specific** - not easily shared like Docker Compose
2. **Dockerfile VOLUME keyword is banned** - must use Railway dashboard volumes
3. **Volume mount paths must be directories** - can't mount to specific files
4. **Environment variable whitespace matters** - trailing spaces break HTTP headers
5. **Ephemeral filesystem** - files outside volumes disappear on redeploy
6. **Dockerfile CMD applies to all services** - need service-specific overrides
7. **Variable references work** - `${{service.VAR}}` syntax for single source of truth

**Best Practices Identified:**
- Mount volumes to directories (`/data`), not files (`/data/file.db`)
- Use `get_db_path()` helper to detect environment (Railway vs local)
- Test persistence after volume setup (force redeploy to verify)
- Delete and re-add variables if spacing issues suspected
- Use service variable references for maintainability

### Strategy Adjustment: Volume Sharing

**Problem:** Railway doesn't support shared volumes between services (unlike Docker Compose)

**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ **Manual database sync** (recommended for now)
   - Scraper writes to temporary local database
   - Download after scraping completes
   - Merge locally on laptop
   - Upload merged database to web service
   - Pros: Simple, proven to work, gives control
   - Cons: Manual step required

2. ❌ **Migrate to PostgreSQL** (future consideration)
   - Both services connect to shared PostgreSQL database
   - Pros: True shared database, Railway native support
   - Cons: Migration effort, not needed for 1000 speakers
   - Added to backlog for post-scaling

3. ❌ **Complex volume workarounds**
   - Investigate Railway volume mount options further
   - Potentially use Railway API
   - Cons: Time-consuming, may not be possible

**Decision:** Use manual sync approach for scaling phase, revisit PostgreSQL later if needed

## Notes for Next Session

### Current Architecture
```
Railway Project: speaker-database

Service 1: web (Active ✅)
├── URL: https://asiasocietyspeakerdatabase-production.up.railway.app
├── Start command: python3 web_app/app.py (from Dockerfile CMD)
├── Volume: /data (persistent, 443 speakers)
├── Environment: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, SITE_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY
└── Status: Working, search functional, database persists

Service 2: scraper (Active ✅)
├── Start command: sleep infinity (overrides Dockerfile CMD)
├── Volume: None (was created then deleted due to sharing limitation)
├── Environment: References web service variables (${{web.VAR}})
└── Status: Running but needs testing with scraping script

Challenge: Services can't share database volume
Solution: Manual sync workflow (scrape → download → merge → upload)
```

### Database Locations
- **Local development**: `./speakers.db`
- **Railway web service**: `/data/speakers.db` (persistent volume)
- **Railway scraper service**: `./speakers.db` (ephemeral, lost on redeploy)

### Cost Tracking
- **Current**: $6/month (web service + volume)
- **During scaling**: Same (scraper doesn't need volume)
- **API costs**: ~$12 one-time for 800 events
- **After scaling**: $6/month (remove scraper service)

### Manual Sync Workflow for Scaling
```
1. Run scraping on Railway scraper service
2. Download scraper's database (figure out method)
3. Merge databases locally:
   - Use merge_duplicates.py
   - Or manual SQLite commands
4. Upload merged database to web service:
   curl -X POST -F "file=@speakers.db" https://asiasocietyspeakerdatabase-production.up.railway.app/admin/upload-db
5. Verify in web interface
6. Repeat for next session
```

### Commands to Remember
```bash
# Test scraper (via Railway CLI or dashboard shell)
./railway_scraper.sh 5

# Upload database to web service
curl -X POST -F "file=@speakers.db" https://asiasocietyspeakerdatabase-production.up.railway.app/admin/upload-db

# Check scraper logs
railway logs --service scraper

# Force redeploy (for testing)
# Railway Dashboard → Service → Deployments → three dots → Redeploy
```

### Decisions Made This Session
1. ✅ Use manual database sync instead of shared volumes
2. ✅ Keep PostgreSQL migration in backlog (not needed now)
3. ✅ Use variable references (`${{web.VAR}}`) for maintainability
4. ✅ Mount volumes to `/data` directory, not specific files
5. ✅ Use Dockerfile for both services (with service-specific CMD overrides)

### Questions to Resolve Next Session
1. How to download database file from Railway scraper service?
   - Railway CLI commands?
   - Add temporary download endpoint?
   - Use railway shell + base64?
2. Best way to merge databases locally?
   - Use existing merge_duplicates.py?
   - Manual SQLite commands?
   - Write merge script?

---

## Development Philosophy (Continued)

**Session 3 additions:**
- **Adapt to platform constraints** - Railway's volume limitations led to manual sync approach
- **Debug systematically** - Fixed issues one at a time (VOLUME → CMD → whitespace → persistence)
- **Test persistence explicitly** - Always verify data survives redeploys
- **Accept good-enough solutions** - Manual sync simpler than fighting platform limitations
- **Document platform quirks** - Railway-specific learnings help future debugging

### 🏗️ Infrastructure & DevOps

**High Priority:**
- **Remove temporary endpoints** (Security Risk!)
  - Delete `/admin/upload-db` route after scaling complete
  - Delete `/admin/download-db` route after scaling complete
  - These are security vulnerabilities if left in production

**Medium Priority:**
- **Migrate to PostgreSQL** (post-scaling consideration)
  - Enables true shared database between services
  - Better for concurrent writes during scraping
  - Railway has native PostgreSQL support
  - Migration path: SQLite → PostgreSQL converter tools
  - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
  - Priority: Low (SQLite works fine for 1000 speakers)
  - Benefits: Scalability, concurrent access, Railway-native volumes

- **Logging infrastructure** (Estimated: 2-3 hours)
  - Replace print statements with Python logging module
  - Add configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  - Log to files with rotation
  - Track API costs and token usage in logs
  - Add structured logging for easier parsing

- **Database optimization**
  - ✅ Add indexes for common queries (COMPLETED in Session 1)
  - Analyze query performance
  - Consider connection pooling if needed

**Low Priority:**
- **Code linting setup** (Estimated: 1-2 hours)
  - Set up pylint or flake8 with project-specific rules
  - Configure black for automatic formatting
  - Add pre-commit hooks for automated checks
  - Integrate with CI/CD if applicable

- **Caching layer**
  - Cache frequently accessed speaker data
  - Cache search results
  - Cache embeddings computation

- **Automated daily scraping** (After scaling complete)
  - Set up Railway cron or GitHub Actions
  - Run 20 events/day automatically
  - No manual intervention required
  - Remove scraper service after this is set up

  - `embedding_engine.py` - Document vector operations and similarity calculations
  - `speaker_search.py` - Document search algorithms and ranking logic
  - `query_parser.py` - Document NLP query parsing approach

- **Complete type hints** (Estimated: 2 hours)
  - Add type hints to all remaining files
  - `query_parser.py` - Add return types to parsing functions
  - `search_speakers.py` - Add types to search functions
  - Ensure consistency across entire codebase

- **Explanatory comments for complex logic**
  - Add comments to remaining algorithms
  - Document non-obvious design decisions
  - Explain any workarounds or edge cases

**Low Priority:**
- **User documentation**
  - Write user guide for web interface
  - Create API documentation if exposing endpoints
  - Document search query syntax
  - Add troubleshooting guide

- **Deployment documentation**
  - Production deployment guide (beyond Railway)
  - Backup and restore procedures
